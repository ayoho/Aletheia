= Statement classifiers

== Absolute facts

"Earth revolves around the Sun."

    Statements that have empirical evidence or some other means to unequivocally confirm their veracity.

== Approximated facts

"The Earth is _about_ 93 million miles away from the Sun."
"The Moon is _roughly_ 240,000 miles away from Earth."

    These statements can be considered facts, even though they don't precisely reflect known absolute facts.
        - Could use statistically meaningly margins to consider whether the fact is true or not.
            - Examples:
                - "The Earth is _about_ 80 million miles away from the Sun."
                    - The real value is 92.96 million miles, which is a 13.9% difference from the stated value. That's statistically significant, so this could be considered **false**.
                - "The Moon is _about_ 240,000 miles away from Earth."
                    - The real value is 238,900 miles, which is a 0.46% difference from the stated value. That's within a statistical margin, so could be considered **true**.

== Facts relative to other facts

"The Earth is further from the Sun than it is from the Moon."
